# Claude Code Agent Instructions

## CRITICAL: Read Full Instructions from AGENTS.md

**IMPORTANT**: At the start of EVERY conversation, you MUST read the `AGENTS.md` file located at the project root to load the complete set of instructions for this Playwright testing framework.

**File location**: `C:\Users\x-typ\Downloads\automations\playwright-mcp-ai-testing\AGENTS.md`

**Why this setup?**
- `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for all agent instructions
- This file (`.claude/instructions.md`) is automatically read by Claude Code at conversation start
- This file instructs you to immediately read `AGENTS.md` for the full instructions

**Your first action**: Use the Read tool to read `AGENTS.md` and follow all instructions contained within it.
